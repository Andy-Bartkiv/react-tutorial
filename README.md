Learn how to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.
Throughout this tutorial, we touched on React concepts including elements, components, props, and state. 

### A final product is a tic-tac-toe game that is capable of:
- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

### Additional features (tasks not covered in tutorial) completed:
- Display the location for each move in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
- Refactor code substituting class components with functional components only.
- Structure React project, separating components, styles etc.
- Finally - Deploy project using <strong>gh-pages</strong>.
